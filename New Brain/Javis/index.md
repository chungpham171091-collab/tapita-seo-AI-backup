## Plugins (tool/hook native cho mọi engine)
- **Date & time** (`datetime-vn`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_now, javis_date_add · Shows the current date and time in the timezone picked in Settings and works out relative dates (tomorrow, in N days, last week). Pure stdlib, read-only, no network needed.
- **Control apps on this computer** (`desktop-apps`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_app_list, javis_app_open, javis_app_close · Opens, closes and lists apps on THE MACHINE running Javis (Windows, macOS, Linux with a screen) when you ask, e.g. "open Chrome", "close Excel", "which apps are open". Blocks itself and says so when Javis runs in Docker on a server, because then the machine running Javis is not yours.
- **Facebook monitor (Apify)** (`fb-monitor-apify`) - bundled/chạy · tools: fb_monitor · Watches PUBLIC Facebook Pages and Groups for highly shared posts through the Apify service. Read-only, never touches a personal account, runs fine on a VPS. Uses the token of the "facebook-monitor" connection.
- **Create and view images (ChatGPT)** (`image-chatgpt`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_generate_image, javis_describe_image · Creates images from a description on the ChatGPT PLAN you are signed in to (OAuth), no OpenAI API key needed. Uses the Codex Responses API with the image_generation tool (gpt-image-2). Images are saved to the vault's attachments/ so they embed straight into chat. Also a tool to VIEW images: ChatGPT looks at an image in the brain and describes it in words, so even engines that cannot see images (OpenRouter, Gemini API...) know what is in it. Needs ChatGPT connected on the Models page.
- **Connect an MCP server** (`javis-connect`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_add_mcp · Adds an MCP server to Javis's connection store right from chat, so it SHOWS on the Connections page like any other account. Before this tool the only route was `claude mcp add`, which lands in Claude Code's own config: no other brain sees it and neither do you on the Connections page.
- **GitHub in chat** (`javis-github`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_github · Shows the chat's GitHub repos (branch, PR, CI, merge) and queues the next job, which Javis starts on its own once the current PR is merged.
- **Background jobs** (`javis-job`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_job · Tracks background commands an engine leaves running (render, build, download). Say in advance "when it's done, do this next", see running jobs, stop one. When it finishes Javis reports back to the right chat and carries on by itself.
- **Cookies** (`javis-login`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_login · Opens a web page that needs a sign-in, using a sign-in the owner stored on the Cookies page. Returns the page text only, never the cookies.
- **Memory from chat** (`javis-memory`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_memory · Lets Javis list, edit and forget the brain's memories, switch new memories on or off, edit the shared profile and revoke an assistant's lessons when the person asks in chat. Replaces the memory and lesson lists that used to sit in the settings column. Only the owner's own sessions see this tool.
- **My tasks and habits** (`javis-mine`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_mytask · Adds tasks to the Mine tab of the Tasks page, lists today's tasks and habits, and ticks a task or a habit session done when the user says they finished it, right from chat.
- **Notification commander** (`javis-notify`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_notify · See and change which notices ring. Each notice group has a mode (everything, important and up, urgent only, off); filter or always ring one kind of notice; undo a change Javis Core made.
- **Plugins from chat** (`javis-plugin`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_plugin · Lets Javis create, read and edit your own plugins in place when you ask in chat, instead of handing you a zip to download and upload again. A new plugin, or one whose code just changed, always stays OFF until you read it and turn it on in the Plugins page. Only the owner's own sessions see this tool.
- **Group bot reply judge** (`javis-reply-policy`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_reply_policy, javis_reply_policy_tune · Lets Javis read the reply judge's numbers (when a group bot spoke or stayed silent, why, where it was marked wrong) and tune it when the owner asks, with undo. Only the owner's own sessions see these two tools; customer-facing bots never do.
- **Recurring jobs & reminders** (`javis-schedule`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_schedule · Create, list and cancel recurring jobs and reminders right from chat. Picks the right store itself: lasting repeat work goes to Javis/loops/<slug>.md so you can edit it in Obsidian; one-off reminders or cron schedules go to the reminder store (5-field cron built in). Replaces hand-writing YAML or curl.
- **Kanban tasks** (`javis-task`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_task · Queues a background task on the Kanban board and shows how far running tasks have got, right from chat. Before this tool only engines that run shell commands (Claude Code, Codex) could queue work, because the only route was curl POST /kanban/task; the five API engines were left out.
- **Team chat management** (`javis-team`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_team · Creates, edits, archives and deletes team chats, adds or removes assistants, picks the leader, and creates new assistants with their own model then adds them, right from chat on every engine. Before this tool it took clicks on the Teams page or driving a browser.
- **Dashboard control** (`javis-ui`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_ui · Opens a page, a file in the brain or a Kanban task, or scrolls the chat on the open dashboard, as you say or type. The dashboard confirms it is done within the same turn; if no tab is open, the tool says so.
- **Web page watch** (`javis-watch`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_watch · Watches a web page on a schedule without spending tokens: alerts when the page changes, when some text appears, or when a price drops below a threshold (understands 1.250.000đ, 250k, $20). Only calls AI when summaries are on.
- **Workflow history** (`javis-workflow`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_workflow · Shows recent workflow runs and the result of each, right from chat. Before this tool a finished workflow's result was lost, and asking "how did the last workflow run go" left Javis nothing to look up.
- **Messenger health check** (`messenger-health`) - bundled/chạy · tools: messenger_check, messenger_repair · Checks each Facebook Page's Messenger bot connection (Page token, permissions, webhook, Page subscription, running bot) and repairs the webhook when the bot goes silent.
- **Meta Ads (Graph API)** (`meta-ads-graph`) - bundled/chạy · tools: meta_ads_accounts, meta_ads_insights, meta_ads_campaigns, meta_ads_get · Reads Facebook/Instagram ad numbers (ad accounts, campaigns, performance) through the Graph API, using the token of the "Meta Ads (your own app)" connection. READ-ONLY, spends no money.
- **Facebook Pages (Graph API)** (`meta-pages-graph`) - bundled/chạy · tools: fb_pages_list, fb_page_posts, fb_page_comments, fb_page_post, fb_page_photo, fb_page_album, fb_page_video, fb_page_edit, fb_page_delete, fb_page_reply · Manages Facebook Pages through the Graph API: list Pages, read posts and comments (read-only), publish posts, photos, videos and albums, edit text, delete posts and reply to comments (full access). Uses the Pages connected on the Facebook Messenger card (Connections page), or the store's Facebook Pages connection when present.
- **Tool usage log** (`tool-audit`) - bundled/tắt · tools: javis_tool_stats · hooks: post_tool_call · Counts how many times EACH tool is called by an engine (through the post_tool_call hook) and shows the most used tools. It is a demo of the plugin HOOK mechanism. OFF by default: turn it on with POST /plugins/toggle (slug=tool-audit) to try it.
- **Voice notes** (`voice-note`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_voice_note · Javis records a short spoken message (up to 1000 characters) as an mp3 in attachments/voice/ and embeds it in the answer. The chat shows a player, Telegram receives the audio file. Uses the free Edge voices, picked by the language of the text.
- **Read YouTube videos** (`youtube-read`) - bundled/chạy · tools: javis_youtube_read · Reads the transcript (subtitles) of a YouTube video from its link so it can be summarised. Cycles through 6 player types, then yt-dlp, when YouTube blocks the server. No sign-in, no API key.
